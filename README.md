🗣️ Talk to Database
Talk to Database is a web application that allows users to interact with a MySQL database using natural language. Built using FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend), this app leverages the OpenAI API to convert user queries into SQL, executes them, and returns the results in a user-friendly format.

🚀 Features
Convert natural language to SQL queries

Execute queries on a MySQL database

View query results in a clean tabular format

Built-in error handling and query validation

Interactive and responsive frontend

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend:

React.js

Tailwind CSS (for styling)

Axios (for API calls)

Backend:

FastAPI

SQLAlchemy (for MySQL interaction)

OpenAI API (for natural language to SQL conversion)

Uvicorn (ASGI server)

Database:

MySQL

OpenAI API Key

🐍 Backend (FastAPI)
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/talk-to-database.git
cd talk-to-database/backend
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file and add:

ini
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
DATABASE_URL=mysql+mysqlconnector://user:password@localhost/dbname
Run the FastAPI server:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main:app --reload
⚛️ Frontend (React)
Navigate to frontend directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the React app:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
📊 Usage
Enter a natural language query (e.g., "Show me all customers from New York").

The backend uses OpenAI to convert it into a SQL query.

The SQL is executed on the MySQL database.

The results are shown in a dynamic table on the frontend.

📎 Example Queries

Natural Language Input	Converted SQL
"List all employees in HR"	SELECT * FROM employees WHERE dept = 'HR';
"How many orders were placed in March?"	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 3;
📌 To Do
Add authentication

Logging & monitoring

Query history

Support for multiple database types
